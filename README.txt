Description
This project is a dynamic single-page web application that dynamically creates navigation based on sections and allows users to leave comments. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive user experience. The main features of this project include:

Dynamic Navigation: The navigation menu is automatically generated based on the sections present in the webpage. As you add or remove sections, the navigation updates accordingly.
Scroll-Based Section Highlighting: As the user scrolls through the page, the section currently in view is dynamically highlighted in the navigation menu. This provides a clear visual indicator of which section is currently being viewed.
Real-Time Comments: Users can leave comments on the page. These comments are submitted through a form and displayed on the page in real-time without requiring a page refresh.
Skills Required
To complete this project, the following skills are required:

HTML:

Structure the page with HTML5 elements.
Create forms for user inputs (such as comments).
Use semantic elements to ensure the page is well-structured and accessible.
CSS:

Style the page layout for a clean and effective design.
Implement responsive design techniques to ensure the page looks good on various devices.

JavaScript:

Implement dynamic behaviors such as generating navigation based on page content.
Handle scrolling events to dynamically highlight sections in the navigation.
Manage form submissions to allow users to leave comments.
Manipulate the DOM to add, remove, and modify elements based on user interactions or events.
Use event listeners to capture user actions like scrolling and form submission.
Validate user inputs to ensure the submitted comments are in the correct format before displaying them.
Detailed Features
Dynamic Navigation
The navigation menu is created dynamically using JavaScript. When the page loads, JavaScript scans for all section elements and generates navigation links for each section. As you scroll, the script highlights the current section in the navigation bar.

Scroll-Based Section Highlighting
Using the IntersectionObserver API or scroll event listeners, the project detects which section is currently in the viewport. The corresponding navigation link is then highlighted, providing a visual cue to the user.

Real-Time Comments
The comment form allows users to submit comments. JavaScript handles the form submission, validates the input, and displays the comment instantly on the page without reloading. This feature enhances user interaction and provides immediate feedback.
